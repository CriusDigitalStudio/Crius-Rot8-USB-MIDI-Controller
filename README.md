# Crius-Rot8-USB-MIDI-Controller
Crius Rot8 is a USB MIDI Controller that cosists of 8 linear Potentiometers with an LED that dims accordingly to the value of each one of them through PWM signals.It also has an LCD Display that shows the percrntage of the value for each of the 8 Potentiometers.

The best part of this project is that it is ABLETON Ready!! I made a custom Script for AUTO MAPPING Potentiometers in ABLETON so you don't have to Map the potentiometers in the Ableton DAW
